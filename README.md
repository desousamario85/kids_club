# Kids Play Club

Kids Play Club website was created to filful most everyday parents needs for their children. As a parent living in Ireland, I know the struggles of finding activities for our children to do during the summer while we have to work. Then we still have the issue on trying to find childcare for our kids. Based on the needs or like to have requirements the Kids Play Club site was created.
