# Kids Play Club

Kids Play Club website was created to fulfil most everyday parents needs for their children. As a parent living in Ireland, I know the struggles of finding activities for our children to do during the summer while we have to work. Then we still have the issue on trying to find childcare for our kids. Based on the needs or like to have requirements the Kids Play Club site was created.

* Favicon
    * Following common practices and is visible in almost every website, is an icon in the address bar, which can be the companyâ€™s logo or Text.
    * For the Kids Play Club I used the first letter of each word to have the favicon created.

* 404 Page
    * 404 pages are a great way to tell the users that they have navigated to a broken link and still keep them on your site.
    * Keep users on your site when they navigate to a broken link, allows the user to go back to the Home Page of the site.
    * This prevents user leaving your site and leaving the impression that the site is broken or down.
